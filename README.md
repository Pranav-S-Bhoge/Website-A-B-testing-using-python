## Hypothesis testing ❓

Imagine you have a hunch about something, but you want to be sure it's not just a coincidence. Hypothesis testing is a way to check your hunch using data.

Here's the breakdown in simpler terms:

The hunch: This is your alternative hypothesis (Ha). It's what you think might be true, like "eating breakfast improves test scores."
The safe bet: This is the null hypothesis (H0). It assumes there's no real effect, like "breakfast doesn't affect test scores." This is your starting point.
Looking for evidence: You collect data (like test scores of students who eat breakfast vs. those who don't).
Making a decision: Based on the data, you see how likely it is that the results happened by chance if the null hypothesis were true (breakfast has no effect). If the chance is very low (usually less than 5%), you reject the null hypothesis and tentatively accept your hunch (breakfast might improve scores).
Think of it like a detective investigating a crime scene (your hunch). The null hypothesis is the assumption of no crime, and the data is the evidence. If the evidence is strong enough to rule out "no crime" (the null hypothesis), then the detective can consider the alternative explanation (your hunch).

** Important to note: Hypothesis testing doesn't prove things absolutely, it just helps you decide if there's enough evidence to reject the "no effect" scenario and explore your hunch further.**

## Hypothesis Testing: Process We Can Follow-->

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to analyze sample data and draw conclusions about a larger population. It involves setting up competing ideas (hypotheses) and using data to see if one is more likely true than the other. This helps make data-driven decisions. Below is the process we can follow for the task of Hypothesis Testing:

      1. Data Collection: Gather the information you need to test your hypothesis.
      2. Formulate Hypotheses: Set up two competing claims: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).
      3. Set Significance Level: Decide on an acceptable level of error (alpha) for rejecting the null hypothesis.
      4. Choose a Statistical Test: Pick the right test based on your data type (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).
      5. Run the Test: Analyze your data using the chosen statistical test.
      6. Interpret Results: Consider the p-value to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
